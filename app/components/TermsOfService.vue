                <h5>2. Trading and Investment risks</h5>
                <p>
                    There is considerable exposure to risk in any crypto-currency exchange transaction.
                    Any transaction involving currencies involves risks including, but not limited to,
                    the potential for changing economic conditions that may substantially affect the price
                    or liquidity of a currency. Investments in crypto-currency exchange speculation may also
                    be susceptible to sharp rises and falls as the relevant market values fluctuate. It is for
                    this reason that when speculating in such markets it is advisable to use only risk capital.
                </p>
                <h5>3. Compliance with tax obligations</h5>
                <p>
                    The users of TomoMaster are solely responsible to determinate what, if any, taxes apply
                    to their crypto-currency transactions. The owners of, or contributors to, TomoMaster are NOT
                    responsible for determining the taxes that apply to crypto-currency transactions.
                </p>
                <h5>4. Limitation of liability</h5>
                <p>
                    Unless otherwise required by law, in no event shall the owners of, or contributors to,
                    the wallet be liable for any damages of any kind, including, but not limited to, loss of use,
                    loss of profits, or loss of data arising out of or in any way connected with the use of the wallet.
                    In no way are the owners of, or contributors to, the wallet responsible for the actions, decisions,
                    or other behavior taken or not taken by you in reliance upon the wallet.
                </p>
                <h5>5. Arbitration</h5>
