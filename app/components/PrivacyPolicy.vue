                    <p>
                        Welcome to TomoMaster, a free, open-source, client-side tool for interacting with the
                        blockchain. TomoChain values privacy and we make a concerted effort to minimize and,
                        to the extent possible, eliminate the exposure of personal data during the use of our
                        interface. TomoMaster does not collect, hold, or store keys, account information,
                        or passwords. We do not collect data passively, do not monetize the collection of data,
                        and do not use your data for marketing or advertising.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To the extent we collect any personal information, this privacy policy (“Policy”)
                        describes how TomoMaster collects, uses, and shares personal information of people who visit
                        our website (the “Site”), use our mobile application, TomoMaster (the “App”),
                        or otherwise use our services (collectively, the “Services”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Policy applies to anyone who accesses the Services. Please read the Policy carefully to
                        understand our practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.
                        By visiting the Site, App, and/or using the Services, you acknowledge that the collection,
                        use, and sharing of your information will take place as described in this Policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So that we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase
                        “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information about an individual that
                        (either by itself or when combined with information from other available sources) allows that
                        individual to be identified, including, the individual’s name,
                        telephone number, or e-mail address.
                    </p>
                    <h3
                        style="text-align: center">
                        THE BLOCKCHAIN</h3>
                    <p>
                        Due to the inherent transparency of many blockchains, including the TomoChain Blockchain,
                        transactions that individuals broadcast via TomoMaster may be publicly accessible.
                        This includes, but is not limited to, your public sending address, the public address of the
                        receiver, the amount sent or received, and any other data a user has chosen to include in a
                        given transaction. Information stored on a blockchain may be public, immutable, and difficult or
                        even impossible to remove or delete. Transactions and addresses may reveal information
                        about the user’s identity and information can potentially be correlated now or in the future
                        by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. Users are encouraged
                        to review how privacy and transparency on the blockchain works.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: center">WHAT WE COLLECT</h3>
